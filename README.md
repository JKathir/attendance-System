Basic sample project 
1.Create a sample service using Java 17 and Spring Boot to implement user authentication with JWT.
2.Develop a login controller that accepts a username and password, validates the credentials, and generates a JWT token.
3.Set the token expiration time to 1 hour and use a simple secret key for signing.
4.Handle authentication errors by throwing an "Unauthorized" message if the username or password is incorrect.
5.Use predefined credentials for testing:
  Username: admin
  Password: password
6.Run the service and use Postman to verify that the token is generated successfully.
7.Create a basic login page using HTML and CSS for the front end.
8.Implement JavaScript to handle user login, validate inputs, send login requests, and redirect authenticated users to the home page.
